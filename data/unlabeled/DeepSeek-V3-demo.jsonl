He pursued a military career and became involved in the political turmoil that characterized Mexico during the 19th century. Zuloaga aligned himself with the conservative faction, which opposed the liberal reforms aimed at reducing the power of the Catholic Church and the military.\n\n### Political Rise:\nZuloaga's political prominence grew during the Reform War (1857\u20131861), a conflict between liberals and conservatives over the implementation of the liberal Constitution of 1857. In 1858, conservative forces, with Zuloaga as one of their leaders, rebelled against the liberal government of President Benito Ju\u00e1rez. Zuloaga was proclaimed interim president of Mexico by the conservative faction, establishing a rival government in Mexico City.\n\n### Presidency and the Reform War:\nDuring his brief presidency (January 1858 \u2013 December 1858), Zuloaga sought to overturn the liberal reforms and restore the privileges of the Catholic Church and the military.

He returned to Mexico during the Second French Intervention (1862\u20131867), when conservative forces, supported by France, briefly established the Second Mexican Empire under Emperor Maximilian I. Zuloaga served in various capacities under the empire but retreated from public life after its collapse in 1867.\n\nZuloaga spent his later years in relative obscurity, passing away in Mexico City on February 11, 1898. His legacy is controversial, as he is remembered as a staunch defender of conservative and traditionalist values during a period of profound political and social change in Mexico. His actions during the Reform War and his opposition to liberal reforms have made him a polarizing figure in Mexican history."}
